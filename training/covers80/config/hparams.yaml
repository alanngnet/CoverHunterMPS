# --- Early Stopping Configuration ---
# early_stop_metric: "val_loss" or "mAP"
#   - "val_loss" (default): Stop when validation loss plateaus. All testsets
#     remain uncontaminated benchmarks suitable for publication.
#   - "mAP": Stop when smoothed mAP plateaus on map_stopping_testsets.
#     Checkpoint selection uses best raw mAP epoch.
#
# For research with publication-grade results:
#   Set early_stop_metric: "mAP" and list only validation-tier testsets in
#   map_stopping_testsets. Other testsets (defined above in this file)
#   will be evaluated and logged but never influence training decisions,
#   preserving their validity as held-out benchmarks.

early_stop_metric: "val_loss"

# map_stopping_testsets: List of testset names that drive stopping decisions.
#   Only used when early_stop_metric: "mAP"
#   Testsets not in this list are benchmark-only (logged but uncontaminated).
#
# map_stopping_testsets: ["reels50easy"]

# map_stopping_patience: Epochs without smoothed mAP improvement before stopping.
#   Only used when early_stop_metric: "mAP"
#
# map_stopping_patience: 5

# map_smoothing_alpha: EMA weight for current mAP observation (0.0-1.0).
#   Higher values = more responsive to recent changes, more noise sensitivity.
#   Lower values = more stable, slower to detect genuine plateaus.
#   Only used when early_stop_metric: "mAP"

# map_smoothing_alpha: 0.3
